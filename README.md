## Installation
There is little set up necessary for this app, simply add all of the files to your website tree (remember to rename any files if you already have one with the same name), and make sure to link to all of the scripts in your main index.html file (or whichever page you wish to display it).
If you wish to use the start modal too, copy the <div class = "container"> item from the index.html file in this app and add it to the same page. You can also use the styling in the style.css file under the section "styling for intro modal".
